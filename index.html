         <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
         <p><strong>My first draft to this project was good I showed my wife what I had created and she 
          thouhgt it was a cool website. The only problem I had was getting my pictures to show inside 
          of the article section. I struggled with this for a few days not knowing what the problem was
          I asked for help during class and we were able to find the problem. The problem was that my 
          file label was label incorrect. In my files I had it labeled with spaces instead of dashes 
          and I also were trying to retrieve my picture from google drive and that was wrong. I had to download
          the pictures and upload the into my img file. This project was very helpful and I'm glad I had
          those problems because I learned from my mistakes.</strong></p>
         
        
         <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
         <p><strong>
          Progressive enhancement is like building a strong base for a house first, making sure it's solid and safe for everyone to use. 
          Then, you add fancy decorations for those who can appreciate them without forgetting about the basic structure. 
          It's about making sure everyone can access your website or app, no matter what kind of device they're using, and then making it even better 
          for those with newer technology. It's a smart way to make sure your stuff works well now and in the future.</strong></p>
